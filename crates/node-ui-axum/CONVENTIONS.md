## UI Conventions

> When working on the UI code, follow these conventions

- We're using Axum, Datastar, PicoCSS, Maud templating
- Keep the use of custom CSS classes to minimum, this is a spirit of PicoCSS 
- Prefer plain and simple look, consistent with PicoCSS
- Use Maud templating systems, NO raw html
